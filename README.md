## Application Goals

1. Be fun!
2. Make a thorough, robust web applicatoin
2. Integrate tests and cross-browser tests
3. Use Webpack to deliver a deployable distribution
4. OOP
5. Clean, readable code

## Education Goals

1. Analyze the process by which we construct the app
2. Identify the skills that the app requires
3. Differentiate between the skills -- hard skills, soft skills -- looking for ways to improve them individually
4. Explore ways to practice, refine, and otherwise teach these skills to aspiring web developers

## Philosophies

1. Deliberate Practice
2. Repeated exposure to quality code
